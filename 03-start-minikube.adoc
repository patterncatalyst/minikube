= Start Minikube
:docinfo: shared

Many people prefer to use virtualbox as the driver.  I prefer to use Docker, however, the NodePort services may not work properly.

== Start Minikube
If you do not have VirtualBox, Vagrant or Docker installed, please go ahead and do so.

====
*Note:* If you do not have *kubectl* installed, please go link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/[here] and install it.
====

Now we can start minikube:
----
minikube start --driver=docker
----

If minikube is running, we should get something like the following for output.
image:minikube-start.png[]


Verify that minikube is running
----
minikube status
----

We should get output like the following:
----
minikube
type: Control Plane
host: Running
kubelet: Running
apiserver: Running
kubeconfig: Configured
----

== Runtime Configuration

The default container runtime in minikube varies and one can be explicitly set.
----
minikube start --container-runtime=docker
----

Other options include:

* https://github.com/containerd/containerd[containerd]
* https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o[cri-o]




== Interact with the cluster

If we have kubectl installed, we can now access the cluster.

----
kubectl get po -A
----

We can also use Minikube to download and use kubectl.

----
minikube kubectl -- get po -A
----

image:minikube-kubectl-get-pods.png[]

Alternatively, we can use this local bash script to start Minikube:

== Managing the cluster

Pause Kubernetes without impacting deployed applications.
----
minikube pause
----

Unpause a paused instance.
----
minikube unpause
----

Halt a cluster.
----
minikube stop
----

Increase the default memory limit (requiring a restart).
----
minikube config set memory 16384
----

Browse the catalog for Kubernetes services.
----
minikube addons list
----

Create a second cluster running an older Kubernetes release.
----
minikube start -p <profile name> --kubernetes-version=v1.16.1
----

== Clean And Check Minikube

If you want to make sure you are using a clean environment, you should first delete the VM:

----
minikube delete
----

If you aren't sure you are running the latest version of minikube:

----
minikube update-check
----

If you don't have the latest version of minikube and wish to update:

link:../bin/minikube-upgrade.sh[Update Minikube Bash Script]
