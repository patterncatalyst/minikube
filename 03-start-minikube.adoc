= Start Minikube

Many people prefer to use virtualbox as the driver.  I prefer to use Docker, however, the NodePort services may not work properly.

== Start Minikube
If you do not have VirtualBox, Vagrant or Docker installed, please go ahead and do so.

====
*Note:* If you do not have *kubectl* installed, please go link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/[here] and install it.
====

Now we can start minikube:
----
minikube start --driver=docker
----

If minikube is running, we should get something like the following for output.
image:minikube-start.png[]


Verify that minikube is running
----
minikube status
----

We should get output like the following:
----
minikube
type: Control Plane
host: Running
kubelet: Running
apiserver: Running
kubeconfig: Configured
----

Alternatively, we can use this local bash script:

== Clean And Check Minikube

If you want to make sure you are using a clean environment, you should first delete the VM:

----
minikube delete
----

If you aren't sure you are running the latest version of minikube:

----
minikube update-check
----

If you don't have the latest version of minikube and wish to update:

link:../bin/minikube-upgrade.sh[Update Minikube Bash Script]
