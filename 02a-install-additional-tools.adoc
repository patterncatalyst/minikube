= Install Additional Tools

You may wish to install some additional tools to assist with Kubernetes.

== Tools for Kubernetes

[NOTE]
All of the MacOS downloads are *amd* links.  If you have a newer Mac, link to the
releases for that tool.

|https://github.com/wercker/stern[stern]
|brew install stern
|Although you can install stern through a direct download, I have found, it will probably not work
correctly on Linux with minikube.  The easiest way to get it working is to install a kubectl
plugin called https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user-guide/setup/install/[krew] first.
Then install stern via krew:

kubectl krew install stern
