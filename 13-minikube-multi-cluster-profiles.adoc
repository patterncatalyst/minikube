We can run multiple minikube cluster instances using minikube profiles.

== Creating Minikube Profiles

To create a cluster with a profile, we need to create the cluster with a profile flag
and a profile name.

[source]
-----
minikube start -p <profile name>
-----

The following command creates a minikube cluster with a profile.

[source]
----
minikube start -p knativesandbox
----

We can then list all the profiles using the _list_ command.

[source]
----
minikube profile list
----

This will give us an output showing all the minikube profiles with information such as;
IP, driver, runtime, status etc...

If we then need to delete a minikube profile, we can use the the following command.

[source]
----
minikube delete -p <profile name>
----

This will delete all the configurations related to the profile.

[source]
----
minikube delete -p dev
----

== Switching Between Minikube Profiles

If we have multiple active minikube profiles, we can switch between profiles using the
minikube command.

To switch to the _dev_ example profile, we can execute the following which will also
switch the kubectl context to that cluster.

[source]
----
minikube profile dev
----

If we need to determine the _current_ profile, we can run the following command.

[source]
----
minikube profile
----

We can also set the profile or pass the profile flag with all minikube commands.

[source]
----
minikube service list -p dev
----
