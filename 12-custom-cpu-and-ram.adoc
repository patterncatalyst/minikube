= Minikube Custom CPU and RAM Resources
:docinfo: shared

Minikube, by default, assigns 2 vCPU and 2048 memory.  When running multiple plugins
and applications, we will require extra CPU and memory.

To override the CPU and memory limits, we can explicitly specify the custom resources.

[source]
----
minikube start --driver=docker --memory 8192 --cpus 4
----

If we want to change the CPU and memory of the existing minikube, we can execute
the following.

[source]
----
minikube stop
minikube config set memory 16384
minikube config set cpus 8
minikube start
----

*NOTE:* Drivers such as Virtualbox require a delete before increasing CPU and memory.
