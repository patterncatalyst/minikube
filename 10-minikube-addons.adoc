There are some advanced Kubernetes features that are available as minikube addons.
For example, the Kubernetes dashboard and metrics server does not come default with
the Minikube installation. But it is available as a minikube addon.
Also, if you want to add a custom docker registry to minikube, you have to install
the [.silver-background]#registry-creds# addon and configure it.

By default, only the storage class addons get installed.

We can list all the available add-ons with the following.
